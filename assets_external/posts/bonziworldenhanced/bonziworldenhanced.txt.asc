BonziWORLD: Enhanced - The latest and greatest BonziWORLD project designed to overhaul everything about everybody’s most hated loved gorilla chatting site!
This has been in on/off development for the past 4 and a half years!

Differences from vanilla BonziWORLD
BWE uses the latest version of socket.io, sanitize-html and nodejs to provide a safe and secure experence for everyone.

Additionally, the following additions have been made to JoeJudge’s code stack:
- - A chat logger with browser notifications when a new message is sent and a discord webhook to relay bonziworld messages to discord!
- - The ability to report misbehaving users to site moderators for review and punishment.
- - Randomly generated godwords for all those folks who prefer to use replit!
- - Actually enforced rules and moderation policies.
- - Brand new re-designed bonzi colors in high-definition!
- - Mouth flapping animations when talking.
- - No more speakjs memory leaks!! (I fixed it lmao)
- - Improved loading speeds. (Fuck you seamus, I removed your 900,000 chars)
- - /youtube can play youtube shorts and playlists now!
- - Brand new /spotify and /soundcloud allowing you to listen to your favorite music tracks on popular platforms!

- - Pre-configured custom themes for skinning bonziworld to your liking.
- - /wtf is back and with new funny/embarassing phrases!!

How do i acquire such an amazing version of bonziworld?
Currently, I have no plans to open-source this project at the moment. Nor do I intend to distribute it out to anybody. Sorry :-)
Why? Because I do not want to distribute a project which I do not deem complete yet. There’s still many many changes I intend to make before I see this as a prefected project.

Why have you done this? Isn’t bonziworld fine on its own?
While it’s true that vanilla copies of bonziworld are okay, it doesn’t mean we should stick with an old project which hasn’t seen an official update from Joe since 2016. I initially created BWE as an nice and simple experiment in 2020 to see what I could do with javascript and eventually, it evolved into a project to improve the shortcomings of outdated 2016ish code.

What’s the catch?
There isn’t any, lmao.

What about all the bad people in bonziworld?
I do not wish or intend to be a major competitor (if any) to other bonziworld servers.
Causing drama is a bad idea and I will not force anyone to use one specific bonziworld server. Please choose whichever site you want to visit.
I won’t force anybody to use BWE under any circumstances. (Moderation and staff are exempt from this so that they can do their job).
TL:DR, You’re free to choose whichever bonziworld server you wish to chat on. Personally, I do not care if this project gains popularity or not, I’m just bringing this experiment out to the world.

Going Forward
I intend on making this project public once I deem it fully-complete.
